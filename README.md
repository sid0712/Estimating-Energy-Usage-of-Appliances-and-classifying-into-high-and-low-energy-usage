# Estimating-Energy-Usage-of-Appliances-and-classifying-into-high-and-low-energy-usage

Task I: Developing and Implementing linear and logistics regression using gradient descent algorithm and tuning various parameters to predict the energy usage of appliances based on temperature, humidity and weather attributes.  

Task II: Implementing supervised learning models using Logistic Regression, Scalar Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier to classify high and low energy household usage of appliances based on temperature, humidity and weather attributes and come up with the best model on the basis of model evaluation parameters of classifiers. The Dataset can be downloaded from UCI_ML_Repository.

steps to run the jupyter file

Copy the dataset from the following URL Dataset I: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction

Unzip the downloaded dataset in the working directory

Go to Anaconda promt, open jupyter noteboook, set the working directory where the datasets were unzipped. Run the jupyter files with extension ipynb

Run the 1st cell with package details before executing anyother cells.
